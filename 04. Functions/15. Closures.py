# A closure is a function that retains the bindings of the free variables
# that exist when the function is defined, so that they can be used later
# when the function is invoked and the defining scope is no longer available.

# a closure is a function with an extended scope that encompasses nonglobal variables
# referenced in the body of the function but not defined there.
