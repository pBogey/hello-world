# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, there, mates! I'm just starting to learn computer programming and chose Python to do so.
I'm not sure what I'm doing here yet.

Decided to use this repository as a journal through my learning process.
So far I have used the following materials:

- A lot of stack overflow
- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python<br>
- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3 3rd Edition<br>
- Fluent Python
