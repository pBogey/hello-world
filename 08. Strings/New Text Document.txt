On philosophy as a system.
If philosophy is the system of rational cognitiona through concepts, it
is thereby already sufficiently distinguished from a critique of pure
reason, which, although it contains a philosophical investigation of the
possibility of such cognition, does not belong to such a system as a
part, but rather outlines and examines the very idea of it in the first
place.
The division of the system can at first only be that into its formal
and material parts, of which the first (the logic) concerns merely the
form of thinking in a system of rules, while the second (the realb part)
systematically takes under consideration the objects which are thought
about, insofar as a rational cognition of them from concepts is possible.
Now this real system of philosophy itself, given the original distinction
of its objects and the essential difference, resting on them, of the
principles of a science that contains them, cannot be divided except
into theoretical and practical philosophy; thus, the one part must be
the philosophy of nature, the other that of morals,c the first of which
is also empirical, the second of which, however (since freedom absolutely
cannot be an object of experience), can never contain anything
other than pure principles a priori.
However, there is a great misunderstanding, which is even quite
disadvantageous to the way in which the science is handled, about what
should be held to be practical in a sensed in which it deserves to be
taken up into a practical philosophy. Statesmanship and political
economy, rules of good housekeeping as well as those of etiquette,
precepts for good health and diet, of the soul as well as of the body
(indeed why not all trades and arts?), have been believed to be able to
be counted as practical philosophy, because they all contain a great
many practical propositions. But while practical propositions certainly
differ from theoretical ones, which contain the possibility of things andtheir determination, in the way in which they are presented, they do
not on that account differ in their content, except only those which
consider freedom under laws. All the rest are nothing more than the
theory of that which belongs to the nature of things, only applied to
the way in which they can be generated by us in accordance with a
principle, i.e., their possibility is represented through a voluntarya
action (which belongs among natural causes as well). Thus the solution
to the problem in mechanics of finding the respective lengths of the
arms of a lever by means of which a given force will be in equilibrium
with a given weight, is of course expressed as a practical formula, but
it contains nothing other than the theoretical proposition that the
length of the arms is in inverse proportion to the force and the weight
if these are in equilibrium; only this relation, as far as its origin is
concerned, is represented as possible through a cause whose determining
ground is the representation of that relation (our choice). It is
exactly the same with all practical propositions that concern merely the
production of objects. If precepts for the promotion of one’s happiness
are given, and, e.g., the issue is only what one has to do in one’s own
case in order to be susceptible to happiness, then all that is represented
are the inner conditions of the possibility of such happiness – in contentment,
in moderation of the inclinations so they will not become
passions, etc. – as belonging to the nature of the subject, and at the
same time the manner of generating this equilibrium as a causality
possible through ourselves alone, hence all of this is represented as an
immediate consequence from the theory of the object in relation to the
theory of our own nature (ourselves as cause): hence the practical
precept here differs from a theoretical one in its form, but not in its
content, and thus a special kind of philosophy is not required for
insight into the connection of grounds with their consequences. – In a
word: all practical propositions thatb derive that which nature can
contain from the faculty of choice as a cause collectively belong to
theoretical philosophy, as cognition of nature; only those propositions
which give the law to freedom are specifically distinguished from the
former in virtue of their content.c One can say of the former that they
constitute the practical part of a philosophy of nature, but the latter
alone groundd a special practical philosophy.It is very important to determine the parts of philosophy precisely and
to that end not to include among the members of the division of
philosophy, as a system, that which is merely a consequence or an
application of it to given cases, requiring no special principles.
Practical propositions are distinguished from theoretical ones either
in regard to principles or to consequences. In the latter case they do
not constitute a special part of the science, but belong to the theoretical
part, as a special kind of its consequences. Now the possibility of things
in accordance with natural laws is essentially distinct in its principles
from that in accordance with laws of freedom. This distinction, however,
does not consist in the fact that in the latter case the cause is
placed in a will, but in the former case outside of the will, in the things
themselves. For even if the will follows no other principles than those
by means of which the understanding has insight into the possibility of
the object in accordance with them, as mere laws of nature, then the
proposition which contains the possibility of the object through the
causality of the faculty of choice may still be called a practical proposition,
yet it is not at all distinct in principle from the theoretical
propositions concerning the nature of things, but must rather derive
its own content from the latter in order to exhibit the representation
of an object in reality.
Practical propositions, therefore, the content of which concerns
merely the possibility of a represented object (through voluntary action),
are only applications of a complete theoretical cognition and
cannot constitute a special part of a science. A practical geometry, as a
separate science, is an absurdity, although ever so many practical propositions
are contained in this pure science, most of which, as problems,
require a special instruction for their solution. The problem of constructing
a square with a given line and a given right angle is a practical
proposition, but a pure consequence of the theory. And the art of
surveying (agrimensoria) cannot in any way presume to the name of a
practical geometry and be called a special part of geometry in general,
but rather belongs among the scholia of the latter, namely the use of
this science for business.*Even in a science of nature, insofar as it rests on empirical principles,
namely in physics proper, the practical procedures for discovering
hidden laws of nature, under the name of experimental physics, can in
no way justify the designation of a practical physics (which is likewise
an absurdity) as a part of natural philosophy. For the principles in
accordance with which we set up experiments must themselves always
be derived from the knowledge of nature, hence from theory. The
same is true of practical precepts, which concern the voluntary production
of a certain state of mind in us (e.g., that of the stimulationa or
restraint of the imagination, the gratification or weakening of the inclinations).
There is no practical psychology as a special part of the
philosophy of human nature. For the principles of the possibility of its
state by means of art must be borrowed from those of the possibility
of our determinations from the constitution of our nature and, although
the former consist of practical propositions, still they do not
constitute a practical part of empirical psychology, because they do not
have any special principles, but merely belong among its scholia.
In general, practical propositions (whether they are pure a priori or
empirical), if they immediately assert the possibility of an object
through our faculty of choice, always belong to the knowledge of
nature and to the theoretical part of philosophy. Only those which
directly exhibit the determination of an action as necessary merely
through the representation of its form (in accordance with laws in
general), without regard tob the meansc of the object that is thereby
to be realized, can and must have their own special principles (in the
idea of freedom); and, although they ground the concept of an object
of the will (the highest good) on these very principles, still this belongs
only indirectly, as a consequence, to the practical precept (which is
henceforth called moral). Further, there can be no insight into its
possibility through the knowledge of nature (theory). Thus only those
propositions alone belong to a special part of a system of rational
cognitions, under the name of practical philosophy.
All other propositions of practice, whatever science they might be
attached to, can, if one is perhaps worried about ambiguity, be calledtechnical rather than practical propositions. For they belong to the
art of bringing about that which one wishes should exist, which in the
case of a complete theory is always a mere consequence and not a selfsubsistent
part of any kind of instruction. In this way, all precepts of
skill belong to technique*1 and hence to the theoretical knowledge of
nature as its consequences. However, we shall in the future also use
the expression ‘‘technique’’ where objects of nature are sometimes
merely judgeda as if their possibility were grounded in art, in which
cases the judgments are neither theoretical nor practical (in the sense
just adduced), since they do not determine anything about the constitution
of the object nor the way in which to produce it; rather through
them nature itself is judged,b but merely in accordance with the analogy
with an art, and indeed in subjective relation to our cognitive
faculty, not in objective relation to the objects.c Now here we will not
indeed call the judgments themselves technical, but rather the power
of judgment, on whose laws they are grounded, and in accordance with
it we will also call nature technical; further, this technique, since it
contains no objectively determining propositions, does not constitute
any part of doctrinal philosophy, but only a part of the critique of our
faculty of cognition.This is the place to correct an error which I committed in the Groundwork 20: 200
for the Metaphysics of Morals. For after I had said that imperatives of skill
command only conditionally, under the condition of merely possible, i.e.,
problematic, ends, I called such practical precepts problematic imperatives, an
expression in which a contradiction certainly lurks. I should have called them
technical imperatives, i.e., imperatives of art. The pragmatic imperatives, or
rules of prudence, which command under the condition of an actual and thus
even subjectively necessary end, also stand under the technical imperatives
(for what is prudence other than the skill of being able to use for one’s
intentions free human beings and among these even the natural dispositions
and inclinations in oneself?). Only the fact that the end which we ascribe to
ourselves and to others, namely that of our own happiness, does not belong
among the merely arbitrary ends justifies a special designation for these
technical imperatives; for the problem does not merely, as in the case of
technical imperatives, require the manner of the execution of an end, but also
the determination of that which constitutes this end itself (happiness), which
in the case of technical imperatives in general must be presupposed as known.contained under the general and subsumea it under the concept of a
nature.
Now such a concept is that of an experience as a system in accordance
with empirical laws. For although experience constitutes a
system in accordance with transcendental laws, which contain the
condition of the possibility of experience in general, there is still possible
such an infinite multiplicity of empirical laws and such a great
heterogeneity of forms of nature, which would belong to particular
experience, that the concept of a system in accordance with these
(empirical) laws must be entirely alien to the understanding, and neither
the possibility, let alone the necessity, of such a whole can be
conceived. Nevertheless particular experience, thoroughly interconnected
in accordance with constant principles, also requires this systematic
interconnection of empirical laws, whereby it becomes possible
for the power of judgment to subsume the particular under the general,
however empirical it may be, and so on, right up tob the highest
empirical laws and the forms of nature corresponding to them, and
thus to regard the aggregate of particular experiences as a system of
them; for without this presupposition no thoroughly lawlike interconnection,*
i.e., empirical unity of these experiences can obtain.
* The possibility of an experience in general is the possibility of empirical 20: 203
cognitions as synthetic judgments. It therefore cannot be drawn analytically
from mere comparison of perceptions (as is commonly believed), for the
combination of two different perceptions in the concept of an object (for the
cognition of it) is a synthesis, which does not make an empirical cognition,
i.e., experience, possible otherwise than in accordance with principles of the
synthetic unity of the appearances, i.e., in accordance with principles through
which they are brought under the categories. Now these empirical cognitions
constitute, in accordance with what they necessarily have in common (namely 20: 204
those transcendental laws of nature), an analytic unity of all experience, but
not that synthetic unity of experience as a system in which the empirical laws,
even with regard to what is different in them (and where their multiplicity
can go on to infinitude), are bound together under a principle. What the
category is with regard to each particular experience, that is what the purposiveness
or fitness of nature to our power of judgment is (even with regard to
its particular laws), in accordance with which it is represented not merely as
mechanical but also as technical; a concept which certainly does not determine
the synthetic unity objectively, as does the category, but which still
yields subjective principles that serve as a guideline for the investigation of
nature.c
a Here Kant crossed out ‘‘so’’ and ‘‘consequently,’’ having originally written ‘‘and so
subsume, consequently,’’.
b Here Kant crossed out ‘‘yet higher, likewise to’’.
c This footnote appears to be an addition to the fair copy.
20: 203This lawfulness, in itself (in accordance with all concepts of the
understanding) contingent, which the power of judgment presumes of
nature and presupposes in it (only for its own advantage), is a formal
purposiveness of nature, which we simply assume in it, but through
which neither a theoretical cognition of nature nor a practical principle
of freedom is grounded, although a principle for the judginga and
investigation of nature is given, in order to seek for particular experiences
the general rules in accordance with which we have to arrange
them in order to bring out that systematic connection which is necessary
for an interconnected experience and which we have to assume a
priori.
The concept which originally arises from the power of judgment
and is proper to it is thus that of nature as art, in other words that of
the technique of nature with regard to its particular laws, which
concept does not ground any theory and does not, any more than logic,
contain cognition of objects and their constitution, but only gives a
principle for progress in accordance with laws of experience, whereby
the investigation of nature becomes possible.b But this does not enrich
the knowledge of nature by any particular objective law, but rather
only grounds a maxim for the power of judgment, by which to observe
nature and to hold its forms together.c
dPhilosophy, as a doctrinal system of the cognition of nature as well
as freedom, does not hereby acquire a new part; for the representation
of nature as art is a mere idea, which serves as a principle, merely for
the subject, for our investigation of nature, so that we can where
possible bring interconnection, as in a system, into the aggregate of
empirical laws as such, by attributing to nature a relation to this need
of ours. On the contrary, our concept of a technique of nature, as a
heuristic principle in the judgmente of it, will belong to the critique of
our faculty of cognition, which indicates what occasion we have to

c Here Kant crossed out the following paragraph:
Philosophy, as a real system of cognition of nature a priori through concepts, thus
does not acquire a new part; for that consideration belongs to its theoretical part. But
the critique of the pure faculties of cognition does indeed acquire such a new part,
and indeed one that is very necessary, by means of which, first, judgments about nature
whose determining ground could easily be counted among the empirical ones are
separated from these, and, second, others, which could easily be taken for real and held
to be determination of the objects of nature, are distinguished from these and cognized
as formal, i.e., rules for mere reflection on things in nature, not for the determination
of these in accordance with objective principles.

III.
On the system
of all the faculties of the human mind.
We can trace all faculties of the human mind without exception back
to these three: the faculty of cognition, the feeling of pleasure and
displeasure, and the faculty of desire. To be sure, philosophers who
otherwise deserve nothing but praise for the thoroughness of their way
of thinking have sought to explain this distinction as merely illusory
and to reduce all faculties to the mere faculty of cognition.2 But it can
easily be demonstrated, and has already been understood for some
time,3 that this attempt to bring unity into the multiplicity of faculties,
although undertaken in a genuinely philosophical spirit, is futile. For
there is always a great difference between representations belonging to
cognition, insofar as they are related merely to the object and the unity
of the consciousness of it, and their objective relation where, considered
as at the same time the cause of the reality of this object, they are
assigned to the faculty of desire, and, finally,a their relation merely to
the subject, where they are considered merely as grounds for preserving
their own existence in it and to this extent in relation to the feeling
of pleasure; the latter is absolutely not a cognition, nor does it provide
one, although to be sure it may presuppose such a cognition as a
determining ground.
The connection between the cognition of an object and the feeling
of pleasure and displeasure in its existence, or the determination of the
faculty of desire to produce it, is certainly empirically knowable; but
since this interconnection is not grounded in any principle a priori, to
this extent the powers of the mind constitute only an aggregate and
not a system. Now it is surely enough to produce a connection a priori
between the feeling of pleasure and the other two faculties if we connect
a cognition a priori, namely the rational concept of freedom, with
the faculty of desire as its determining ground, at the same time subjectively
finding in this objective determination a feeling of pleasure
contained in the determination of the will.b,4 But in this way theof cognition is not combined with the faculty of desire by means of
the pleasure or displeasure, for this does not precede the latter faculty,a
but either first succeeds the determination of it, or else is perhaps
nothing other than the sensation of the determinability of the will
through reason itself, thus not a special feeling and distinctive receptivity
that requires a special section under the properties of the mind.
Now since in the analysisb of the faculties of the mind in general a
feeling of pleasure which is independent of the determination of the
faculty of desire, which indeed is rather able to supply a determining
ground for that faculty, is incontrovertibly given, the connection of
which with the other two faculties in a system nevertheless requires
that this feeling of pleasure, like the other two faculties, not rest on
merely empirical grounds but also on a priori principles, there is thus
required for the idea of philosophy as a system (if not a doctrine then
still) a critique of the feeling of pleasure and displeasure insofar as
it is not empirically grounded.
Now the faculty of cognition in accordance with concepts has its a
priori principles in the pure understanding (in its concept of nature),
the faculty of desire, in pure reason (in its concept of freedom), and
there remains among the properties of mind in general an intermediate
faculty or receptivity, namely the feeling of pleasure and displeasure,
just as there remains among the higher faculties of cognition an intermediate
one, the power of judgment. What is more natural than to
suspect that the latter will also contain a priori principles for the former?
c
Without yet deciding anything about the possibility of this connection,
a certain suitability of the power of judgment to serve as the
determining ground for the feeling of pleasure, or to find one in it, is
already unmistakable, insofar as, while in the division of faculties of
cognition through concepts understanding and reason relate their
representations to objects, in order to acquire concepts of them, the
power of judgment is related solely to the subject and does not produce
any concepts of objects for itself alone. Likewise, if in the general
division of the powers of the mind overall the faculty of cognition as
well as the faculty of desire contain an objective relation of representations,
so by contrast the feeling of pleasure and displeasure is only
the receptivity of a determination of the subject,d so that if the power
of judgment is to determine anything for itself alone, it could not be
